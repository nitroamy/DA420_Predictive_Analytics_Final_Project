# DA420_Predictive_Analytics_Final_Project
Final Project for Predictive Analytics Class

For my final project, I did text/sentiment analysis on twitter comments including a specific keyword as “#keyword.” I chose the presidential election as a theme and picked four keywords to carry out my text/sentiment analysis. The main goal of this project was to understand methodology of text/sentiment analysis, as well as the application of this method to real world case scenario, which was to analyze tone and emotion of twitter comments on the presidential election.  
 
Sentiment analysis is the interpretation and classification of emotions within text data using text analysis techniques. It allows to identify the emotional tone in the text. In the real word application, businesses use sentiment analysis techniques to analyze not only customer data but also internal business data to make important decisions.

In this project, there are three major parts to accomplish the goal I stated earlier. These three major parts are: 1) text mining, 2) sentiment analysis 3) visualization. Text mining would allow me to extract text data from twitter and preliminary process of texts ready for sentiment analysis.  Sentiment analysis would consist of two different methods, bing (for polarity, negative and positive, analysis) and nrc (for emotion analysis). Finally, visualization would allow me to put all data together as charts and word clouds for the data presentation.
